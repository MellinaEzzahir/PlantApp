# PlantApp
A simple app that reminds people to water and track their plants.
You can add a login(sort of), add a plant, delete them or edit them. 
They all have information stored in a database.

I made my project because during the summer holidays my dad always forgets to water my plants and they die :(.

The project is made in React native with expo, and the database part is appwrite.

The hardest part was learning how to link the backend because I've never done it before, especially doing the login. 
The easiest/funnest part was the styling and I spent way too much time choosing colours.
